# üíô Genially (review)
This project introduces a digital tool for creating visual materials called Genially. It presents a good language learning tool that allows for dynamic integration of various multimedia into visual information, which I think has been very educational for English teachers. The app's practicality and potential are well presented, however, it seems that more consideration is needed for the actual students. For instance, if we consider the topics of video examples, it could be insightful to think about how English learning will be structured around the content that students will encounter when using the app, or even recognize that teaching how to use the app is part of the language learning process. This might allow us more specifically to consider the language skills students will gain from a student-centric perspective of language learning . When considering a preparatory lesson, it would have been more helpful for the teachers being introduced to this tool to think more concretely about its applicability if more specific examples were shown rather than, for example, just describing 'the teacher explains it concretely.'

As interesting as the app was, there were many questions and there were desires for these questions to be included in the introduction.

|R1| It looks like Genially is helpful for teachers to prepare the materials. I want to try it.|
|R2	|Overall good, but it would be even better if they showed us more detailed functions after selecting a few related to language teaching.|
|R3	|Thanks for your presentation. The inclusion of numerous screen captures in the .md file greatly enhanced my understanding of Genially. The clear summary of its pros and cons also provided deeper insights. I was particularly impressed with the Gamification template section; I believe this feature will be highly effective in facilitating children's learning. Furthermore, given its use in children's education, I am eager to learn more about any potential account creation and login issues and the unique benefits this tool offers compared to Canva.|
|R4|Thanks for introducing a useful tool for teachers! It will lessen teachers' work for an effective class!|
|R5	|The team explained about the potential problem and the solution, so we could understand how we fix the problem.|
|R6	|Your md file gives much better information than the video file. It give useful information of how to use it in different ways. But, I don't think it's fair to upload it later, after seeing all other groups' work and presentation.|
|R7	|The digital tool presented by Group 3 felt familiar to teachers yet seemed more like a tool for teachers rather than for students. It provides teachers with various tools that can be used during class time, but its usability for students seems limited, especially in terms of interaction between students and between students and teachers. Additionally, the website gave the impression that it is more tailored for students to review and prepare on their own at home, rather than being directly integrated into classroom activities.|
|R8	|The platform 'Genially' offers versatile content creation, rich multimedia integration, real-time collaboration and feedback, and ensures accessibility for diverse learners. Also, Genially is particularly useful for adapting to diverse learning styles and levels, making it easier to accommodate various cases.|
|R9	|We shared ideas to decide ‚ÄúGenially‚Äù for our tool to introduce. Bori Choi (I) made the script for the PPT and presentation, and Hanna Jang the PPT Slides, and Jiwoo Han the Video clip, and Junhyung Park was in charge of the Presentation. Also, Hanna Jang and Bori Choi (I) did the MD file. Each of the group members did his/her job, but Hanna Jang especially worked hard and was most punctual, cooperative to work with.|
|R10|It was really interesting to use text to speech tools.	|
|R11|I think It was useful tool for teacher.|
|R12|Overall, good work! Keep up the good effort.	|
|R13|I've used this tool before so it was interesting to see how another group would use it. It's great for interactive content in the classroom!	|
|R14|At first, it was a little bit unclear about how to use it, but that looks nice tool for organizing classes and I'd like to try it in my class some day.|
