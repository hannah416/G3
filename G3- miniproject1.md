## 🔹 Step ② In the next class, after a quick review of the presentation, the teacher makes the students sit in groups of 4 students and explains about the Poster Day project.

- Each group of 4 students will discuss which planet was most interesting.
- The teacher helps the groups choose 1 out of 8 planets not to be overlapped and tells the students to brainstorm for their posters.
- The teacher explains to all the students to try to use the “poster” template of Genially to be familiar with before the next class.

-> This Poster Day project fosters **communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking skills**, not focusing on the perfection of each work of the posters.


👏 **The poster that students made in class through Genially using their devices** 👏
