## 🔹 Step ② After a quick review of the presentation, the teacher makes the students sit in groups of 4 students and explains about the Poster Day project 
(Not using Genially, just in class..

- Each group of 4 students will discuss which planet was most interesting
- The teacher helps the groups choose 1 out of 8 planets not to be overlapped and tells the students to brainstorm for their posters
- The teacher explains to all the students to try to use the “poster” template of Genially to be familiar with before the next class

-> This Poster Day project fosters communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking skills, not focusing on the perfection of each work of the posters.





## 🔹 Step ③ Lastly, the teacher wraps up the lesson on the “Solar System” with the interactive quiz 
(Use one of the Genially's templates - quiz template)
